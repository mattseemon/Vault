## Hardcodet.NotifyIcon.Wpf (1.1.0)

### Description
This is an implementation of a NotifyIcon (aka system tray icon or taskbar icon) for the WPF platform. 

It does not just rely on the Windows Forms NotifyIcon component, but is a purely independent control which leverages several features of the WPF framework in order to display rich tooltips, popups, context menus, and balloon messages. It can be used directly in code or embedded in any XAML file.

Source code and extensive sample application available at http://www.hardcodet.net/projects/wpf-notifyicon

Notwithstanding the above, the Author reserves the right to release the Work under different license terms or to stop distributing the Work at any time; provided, however that any such election will not serve to withdraw this License (or any other license that has been, or is required to be, granted under the terms of this License), and this License will continue in full force and effect unless terminated as stated above.
